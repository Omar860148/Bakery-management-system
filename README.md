# Bakery-management-system
# This Bakery Shop Management System was build single handedly by Omar mohamed using PHP and MySQL Database. The system requires user credentials in order for the management can access the data, features, and functionalities. It has 2 types of user roles which are the Administrators and Cashiers. The Administrator Users are the ones who can manage the products, stocks, and categories. They also have the privilege to access and manage all the features and functionalities of what the system does. The Cashiers are only allowed to manage transactions and list the sales report of their transactions. This has a Point of Sale feature to manage the shop's daily sales. It has also a feature that generates a printable receipt and date-wise sales report.
